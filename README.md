# Streamlit Form Project

This project demonstrates how to build a responsive form layout using Streamlit, divided into three sections with different input fields and submission forms.

## Features

- **Number and Selection Inputs**: 
  - Input fields for age, height, city of birth, and favorite color using `number_input`, `slider`, and `selectbox`.
  - A checkbox to capture whether the user smokes or not.
  
- **Text Input Fields**: 
  - A sample form with fields like name, email, phone number, subject, and a message box using `text_input` and `text_area`.
  
- **Advanced Form**:
  - Multi-selection options for hobbies, date pickers for start and end dates, a color picker, and an image uploader.
  
- **Dynamic Feedback**:
  - Once the forms are submitted, the entered values are displayed dynamically for user feedback.
